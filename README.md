# Raison dâ€™Ãªtre <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="360" />

This package is designed for rainy days when your results are
heartbreaking or when no matter what you try, you canâ€™t seem to get rid
of that bug. Take a respite from those negative thoughts by accessing
kitty pics **and** their adorable meows right from your R console ðŸ˜» and
then get back to work again!

# Installation

When available on `CRAN`, you can download it by running:

``` r
install.packages("kittyR")
```

You can get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/kittyR")
```

# Functions

There are only two available functions in this package-

In case you want a picture of a kitty:

``` r
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(123)

# show me the kitty NOW!
kittyR::kittyR()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-kittyR1-1.png" width="100%" />

By default, the collection will include any kind of cat (big, small,
wild, etc.). If you want only kittens, you can use an additional
argument.

``` r
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(14)

# show me the kitten NOW!
kittyR::kittyR(meow = FALSE, only_kitten = TRUE)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-kittyR2-1.png" width="100%" />

The collection of cat pictures comes from the following collections of
freely available images:

-   <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cat/>
-   <https://www.reshot.com/search/cat/>
-   <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kitten/>
-   <https://www.reshot.com/search/kitten/>

In case you just want to hear a meow either *apropos* nothing or at the
end of execution of some code to let you know that the execution is
complete, just include this line of code:

``` r
# can't print the sound, so
# meow meow meow
# you can choose from a sample of sounds included in the package
kittyR::meowR(sound = 4)
```

If you have a kitty meow that you like and would like to include in the
package, please either make a PR or e-mail it to me and I will include
it.

This package was inspired by
[pupR](https://github.com/melissanjohnson/pupR) package by Melissa
Innerst.

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful
data digging jobs!
